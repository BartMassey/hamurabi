# HAMURABI.BAS In Python 3

**Status: The Python GOTO module I'm using is currently
broken. It looks like it will be fixed shortly. In the
meantime, this code is broken. I looked at ways around it
and decided it was too much work to be worth it.**

This code is my very direct port to Python 3 of the famous
HAMURABI.BAS, Creative Computing's port to a more modern
BASIC of Peter Turnbull's port to 8K Microsoft BASIC of
David Ahl's port to "EDUSYSTEM 70" (whatever that is) of
Doug Dyment's FOCAL (whatever that is) program *The Sumer
Game.*

I tried to mirror the CC BASIC version as much as Python 3
allows.  In particular, I used a Python 3 `goto` module from
GitHub.  You'll need it as well:
<http://github.com/cdjc/goto>. Just put `goto.py` someplace
where Python can find it.

The copyright status of all this is murky, to say the
least. I will leave this code here until one of the
potential owners asks me to take it down. In the meantime,
I've put my copyright on the work (and also proper
attribution) and made it available under the MIT
License. Please see the file `COPYING` in this distribution
for license details.
